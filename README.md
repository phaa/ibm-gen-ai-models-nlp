## About the Course

This IBM course teaches implementation, training, and evaluation of generative AI models for natural language processing (NLP).  
You’ll learn to build models for document classification, language modeling, translation, and understand both small and large language model fundamentals.

Key topics covered:

- Feature extraction approaches: one-hot encoding, bag‑of‑words, embeddings, and embedding bags  
- Word2Vec embeddings for text representation  
- Neural network modeling with PyTorch for document categorization  
- Classical language models: N‑gram models and sequence‑to‑sequence architectures  
- Evaluation metrics for generated text, including BLEU and perplexity

The course is structured into **two modules**, combining theory, coding labs, and quizzes.
